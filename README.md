# TIC_TAC_TOE
Creating a Tic Tac Toe game in Python is a fun project!

# Gameplay
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on the grid.
The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
If all spaces on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.
